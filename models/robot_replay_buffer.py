        The sepecific memory optimizations use here are:
            - only store each frame once rather than k times
              even if every observation normally consists of k last frames
            - store frames as np.uint8 (actually it is most time-performance
              to cast them back to float32 on GPU to minimize memory transfer
              time)
            - store frame_t and frame_(t+1) in the same buffer.

        For the tipical use case in Atari Deep RL buffer with 1M frames the total
        memory footprint of this buffer is 10^6 * 84 * 84 bytes ~= 7 gigabytes

        Warning! Assumes that returning frame of zeros at the beginning
        of the episode, when there is less frames than `frame_history_len`,
        is acceptable.

        Parameters
        ----------
        size: int
            Max number of transitions to store in the buffer. When the buffer
            overflows the old memories are dropped.
